I am a pre-final year student at Amity University pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science & Engineering. 
I love to dive deep into designing data structures and implement them in Java. Besides 
my university curriculum, I often find myself thinking & learning about algorithms, and analysing them. I am a passionate frontend developer.



As part of my university coursework & projects, I have also worked in C++, C, HTML, CSS and SQL. 
I am eager to apply my problem solving skills and strong CS fundamentals while working on challenging
& impactful projects.
