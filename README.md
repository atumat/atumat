I am a sophomore at Amity University pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science & Engineering. 
I love to dive deep into designing data structures and implement them in Java. Besides 
my university curriculum, I often find myself thinking & learning about algorithms, and analysing them using 
time & space complexity. My interest also lies in Web development.


As part of my university coursework & projects, I have also worked in C++,C,HTML, CSS and SQL. While in school,
I was ranked 791 worldwide in the International Informatics Olympiad in 2010. 
I am eager to apply my problem solving skills and strong CS fundamentals while working on challenging
& impactful projects.
